# üîçFairness Analysis for Face Verification 

This repository provides the fair dataset of synthetic faces created in the paper **Fairer Analysis and Demographically Balanced Face Generation for Fairer Face Verification** published at WACV 2025 (see [credits](#-acknowledgments-and-credits)). We plan to release the code to generate other synthetic datasets.

If you are rather interested by tools for conducting a comprehensive fairness analysis of face verification models, look at [this repository](https://github.com/MSoumm/FaVFA) or [this one](https://github.com/CEA-LIST/FaVFA) (both should be the same).

# Dataset
The dataset `DCFace+C-all` can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/f/c/c452783a8b2f31f6/EqlQKhaeU1lNnZkaDEw8MI0BAz4HbnFzFmvsc3ecy1S-IA?e=bI4uaJ)

It has a size and structure comparable to previous training sets of face verification models such as [digiface-1m](https://github.com/microsoft/DigiFace1M), [SynFace](https://github.com/haibo-qiu/SynFace) or [CASIAWebFace](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debarghamitraroy/casia-webface). More precisely it contains:
* 10,000 unique identities
* 50 images per identity thus 500,000 images in total

Images were balanced with regards to four attributes, namely *gender* (2 classes), *ethnicity* (4 classes), *age* (continuous) and  *pose* (3 continuous angles).
